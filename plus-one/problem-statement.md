# Plus One

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of decimal digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Notes

My original solution is ridiculous and a good example of:

1. Diving into coding a solution before taking time to think through the problem.
2. Doing too many "Leetcode" style coding problems and starting to look at every solution as a convoluted array manipulation. You know what they say about someone who's only tool is a hammer...

I split the better solution out into the hard-to-read one-liner chaining everything together and also a more readable and verbose function implementing the same methods.
