# Counting Valleys

## Problem Statement

- A crazy hiker keeps records of every single step of their daily hikes recording whether each step was uphill "U" or downhill "D".
- Given a String that represents one of these hikes you must determine how many valleys the hiker traversed.
- A valley is traversed any time the hiker proceeds down ("D") below sea level into a valley and then returns back up ("U") to sea level out of the valley.
- Every hike starts at sea level.
- Each step "U" or "D" represents 1 unit of elevation change.
- Example Input: "DDUUDUDU" => Output is 3
