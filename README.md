# Code Challenges

Solutions to various code challenges or word problems that I've worked on and found interesting.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is included as a dependency instead of a dev-dependency because the only thing to do with these functions is run unit tests against them and make sure they return the expected output.

Run `npm test` in a terminal to run the JavaScript test suites via Jest.

For problems with Python solutions `cd` to the appropriate directory and run `pytest`.
